# Excel-Project-on-HealthCare-Dataset
Team-based Excel project analyzing healthcare data. I contributed to cleaning and organizing datasets, applying formulas (IF, VLOOKUP, statistical, date), and creating PivotTables and charts to visualize treatment costs, diagnoses, and demographic trends for better insights and decision-making.
