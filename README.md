Excel Health Data Analysis Project

This project involved a team-based analysis of healthcare records using Microsoft Excel. Our objective was to transform a messy dataset of patient visits, diagnoses, doctors, and treatment costs into clear, actionable insights.

My Role:
I contributed to data cleaning, formula application, and visualization design, ensuring the dataset was accurate, structured, and ready for reporting. I also helped create PivotTables and charts that summarized key metrics such as treatment costs, gender distribution, and diagnosis trends.

Project Highlights:

*Cleaned and standardized raw healthcare data (removed duplicates, formatted dates, handled missing values).

*Applied advanced Excel formulas: IF, VLOOKUP, ROUND, statistical and date functions.

*Built dynamic PivotTables and PivotCharts to visualize trends across demographics and diagnoses.

*Improved data readability through structured formatting and conditional highlighting.

Collaboration:
Completed as part of a group project, where each member contributed to different stages of cleaning, analysis, and presentation.
