Excel Health Data Analysis Project

This project involved a team-based analysis of healthcare records using Microsoft Excel. Our objective was to transform a messy dataset of patient visits, diagnoses, doctors, and treatment costs into clear, actionable insights.

My Role:
I contributed to data cleaning, formula application, and visualization design, ensuring the dataset was accurate, structured, and ready for reporting. I also helped create PivotTables and charts that summarized key metrics such as treatment costs, gender distribution, and diagnosis trends.

Project Highlights:

*Cleaned and standardized raw healthcare data (removed duplicates, formatted dates, handled missing values).

*Applied advanced Excel formulas: IF, VLOOKUP, ROUND, statistical and date functions.

*Built dynamic PivotTables and PivotCharts to visualize trends across demographics and diagnoses.

*Improved data readability through structured formatting and conditional highlighting.

Key Insights & Learnings

Through our analysis, we uncovered several patterns in patient behavior, treatment costs, and provider performance:

*Patient Demographics:
The hospital serves a balanced gender population, but the elderly group dominates visits, indicating higher healthcare utilization among older patients.
*Seasonal Trends:
Patient visits peaked in September, suggesting possible seasonal or operational influences on hospital workload.
*Cost Drivers:
Migraine, cancer, COVID-19, and hypertension emerged as the top diagnoses driving up total healthcare costs. These conditions require intensive care and long treatment durations.
*Treatment Insights:
Surgery and therapy accounted for the highest costs, reflecting their complex and resource-heavy nature.
*Provider Impact:
A few doctors—particularly Dr. Wong, Dr. Lee, and Dr. Patel—handled a disproportionately high number of patients and cases, especially among the elderly, highlighting potential workload and resource distribution issues.

What We Learned

*Working as a team taught us how structured data cleaning, thoughtful analysis, and visualization can uncover critical operational insights from messy healthcare records. Beyond building dashboards, we focused on:

*Asking the right analytical questions before visualizing.

*Connecting data patterns to real-world implications for healthcare management.

*Presenting insights that can support strategic decisions like optimizing doctor allocation, understanding patient load by age, and identifying cost-heavy treatments.

Collaboration:
Completed as part of a group project, where each member contributed to different stages of cleaning, analysis, and presentation.
